# Demo Ruby Project

This project can be used as a template for the work we do in the apprenticeship program and Weirich. It is simply a Ruby project template with the `rspec` and `guard` gems.

## Setup

1. Clone the project
1. Install Ruby using your package manager of choice (I like `asdf`, but use whatever)
1. Run `bundle install`

## Testing

1. Run `bundle exec rspec spec` for a single run.
1. Run `bundle exec guard` to start the test watcher.
